The clusterList is a vector< vector<point> >.This clusterlist will have 5 clusters sorted according to their sizes.
To prepare this Clusterlist:
1) Applied K-means
2) Merge the clusters which were close to each other
3) Sort the ClusterList according to cluster sizes
4) After sorting the top 5 Clusters retained, rest were erased.
5) Hospital location will be centroids of these 5 final clusters.

Output: hospitals (vector containing hospital locations) 

Please sort the number of ambulances from input file and assign them is descending order to the above mentioned vector, with hospitals.at(0) getting the max number of ambulances. 

If needed, can perform parameter tuning based on intial number of cluster(asked by user), though won't recommend anything more than 35.
