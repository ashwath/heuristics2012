Corner Chess

Consider a 4 by 4 corner of a chessboard.
Each player uses the normal chess pieces (king, queen,
two castles, two bishops, and two knights) but without pawns.
White goes first as usual and begins by placing the king anywhere on the
board.
Then Black places a king.
Players alternate "plys" where a "ply" consists
of placing a single piece on any
blank square or moving a piece according to the normal moving
rules.
When a piece is taken it can never again come back into the game.
White may not put Black in check until Black checks White or unless
each player has done ten plys whichever comes first.
Of course neither player may move into check.

Win by checkmating opponent.

Will initially be created with JavaScript, jQuery, jQuery UI.  Human players/interface.

Stages of development are:
1. Setup basic board/pieces
2. Work on piece attributes
3. Determine legal maneuvers
4. Setup capturing/scoring
5. Setup end game conditions
